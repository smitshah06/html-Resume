            <ul>
                <li>Worked on a Resume Parser project for the extraction of useful information from the Resume.</li>
                <li>Goal was to extract Information like name, phone number, email address, GitHub ID, LinkedIn ID, Skills, Education, and
                    Work Experience.</li>
                <li>Learned how to do the project requirement analysis, Design, Development, testing, and Execution.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <li><h3>Technical Intern, ElasticRun, Pune-Maharashtra	</h3></li>

                <li>It is a 4-month internship starting from September, 2022 to December,2022.</li>
                <li>Learning New Framework named Frappe Framework which is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written
                    in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <li><h3>Larsen and Toubro (L&T) Energy Power, Vadodara-Gujarat</h3></li>
        <p>January, 2023- May, 2023
            <ul>
                <li>Worked as a ML-DL Intern</li>
                <li>Worked on a project titled water-logging detection and vegetation detection using Deep Learning.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques</h3></li>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed SVM(support vector machine), Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LSTM, CNN to Distinguish
                    between Fake and Real news.</li>
                <li>
                    The pre-processing steps involve stopwords removals, Duplication Removal, removing null values, attribution/feature
construction, Aggregation, and Normalization.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <li><h3>Background removal from diamond images using Image Processing or ML techniques </h3></li>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The mask of the diamond images is not available so first we have to create the mask by image processing and with the
                    help of the mask we train the pix-to-pix Gan model..</li>
                <li>
                    Image processing includes - power-law transformation, image smoothing, convex-hull, etc. in Matlab
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    </ul>
